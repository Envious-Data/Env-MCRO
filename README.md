# Env-MCRO
 A Raspberry Pi Pico powered Macro board, like a Streamdeck but cheaper and simpler.

###What This?
This is another another mechanical keyboard type thing, this is a small 12 key macro board intended to be used for F13 to F24 but you can do whatever.

Once again This will use KMK and Circuitpython.

I do feel like the rpi pico is a bit overkill for this use, a tiny2040 will probably fit better, Ill have to see if someone has made kidcad bits for that if not Ill probably have to make them my self or whatever.


### Parts List
* 1x Raspberry Pi Pico
* 12x Keyboard Switches
* 12x 1N4148 Diodes (through hole)
* 12x Keycaps
* Macro Board PCB
